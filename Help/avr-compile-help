# To compile programs for AVR's use avr-gcc
avr-gcc -mmcu=atmega8 -Wall -Os -o blink.elf main.c
# --- -mmcu=atmega8 specifies the MCU model
# --- -Os means optimization level 0, this is needed for avr delay

# To convert the elf tile to Intel hex for avrdude use:
avr-objcopy -j .text -j .data -O ihex blink.elf blink.hex

# Then to program use avrdude
avrdude -p m8 -c usbasp -e -U flash:w:blink.hex
# --- -p m8 specifies the MCU, here atmega8
# --- -e means erase
# --- -U means memory type
# --- :w means write
# --- "-e -U flash:w:blink.hex" specifies flash memory + erase option, and write blink.hex (:w:blink.hex)
