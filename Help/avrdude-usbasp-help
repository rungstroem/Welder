# The USBASP doesn't show up in the /dev folder
# --- ie. DON'T expect /dev/ttyUSB0 to exist.
# --- And don't setup udev rules to make ttyUSB0 appear, it doesn't work
#
# Instead avrdude knows the vendorID and productID and communicates directly with the USBASP programmer

# For example	(remember to use sudo)
# --- To read the device EEPROM using the USBASP use the following
avrdude -p m8 -c usbasp -U eeprom::r:myfile.hex:i	# m8 is the processor, here atmega8

# --- To read the device FLASH using the USBASP use the following
avrdude -p m8 -c usbasp -U flash::r:myfile.hex:i
